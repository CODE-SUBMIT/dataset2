# Layout of Custom-size Furniture Dataset
## Overview
This repository contains the Layout of Custom-size Furniture Dataset (LCSF) of indoor custom-size furniture layouts together with an end-to-end rendering image of the interior layout. This dataset is obtained from designers at the real selling end. In particular, the designs are from 60 professional designers who work with an industry-level virtual tool. Among these designs, many are sold to the proprietors for their interior decorations. We collect these designs at the selling end and provide 710,700 interior layouts. 

Each layout sample contains the categories of the furniture in the room, the position (x, y) and size (height, width, length) of each furniture, and the position (x, y) and size (height, width, length) of the doors, windows, and walls in the room. Besides, the category of the finished furniture and customized furniture is provided. For the customized furniture, the size (height, width, length) is set to the default size in the layout. The sizes of customized furniture are different for different layouts of the same room. 

The dataset contains 200 balcony layouts, 22,000 bedroom layouts, 185,000 kitchen layouts, 400,000 bathroom layouts, 80,000 living-dining room layouts, 1700 study room layouts, and 20,000 tatami room layouts.
